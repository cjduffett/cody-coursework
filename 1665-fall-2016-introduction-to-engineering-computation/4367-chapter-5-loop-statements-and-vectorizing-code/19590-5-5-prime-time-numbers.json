While MATLAB has a built in function called *isprime()*, you are to write your own \"isitprime\" function.  Your function should determine for any positive number if that number is prime,  returning either logical 1 if prime or logical 0 if not. If you're really stuck, a quick Google search should turn up how to compute prime numbers.\n\n<https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I5zkM12T4-4/ Tutorial on How to Solve>","type":0,"template":"function primality = isitprime(number)\n\n    \n     primality = \nend","solution":"function primality = isitprime(number)\n    mod_int = 2;\n    \n    while (rem(number,mod_int) ~= 0)\n        mod_int = mod_int + 1;\n    end\n    \n    if (mod_int == number)\n        primality = true;\n    else\n        primality = false;\n    end\nend","visibleTests":"","hiddenTests":"%%\n\n% testing cases of primality\nn = 13;\nassert(isitprime(n)==logical(1), 'Wait!
